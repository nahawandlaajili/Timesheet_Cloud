Employee hits POST /api/leaves/request?userId=1&startDate=2025-10-01&endDate=2025-10-05
POST /api/leaves/request?userId=1&startDate=2025-10-01&endDate=2025-10-05

Service checks if user has enough remaining days.

If yes → creates a leave request, approves it, reduces days left.

Employee can view all his leaves at GET /api/leaves/user/{userId}.
---

Instead of auto-approving inside LeaveService, we’ll separate:

Employee Request → status = PENDING (no deduction yet).

Admin Approves → status = APPROVED (deduction happens).
PUT /api/leaves/10/approve

Admin Rejects → status = REJECTED (no deduction).

approval flow

Flow Example

Employee:
POST /api/leaves/request?userId=1&startDate=2025-10-01&endDate=2025-10-05
→ Creates request, status = PENDING.

Admin:

PUT /api/leaves/10/approve → Status = APPROVED, user’s days reduced.

PUT /api/leaves/10/reject → Status = REJECTED, no deduction.

---
API

/api/leaves/request → employee submits a request.

/api/leaves/{leaveId}/approve → admin approves a request.

/api/leaves/{leaveId}/reject → admin rejects a request.
