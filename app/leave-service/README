This service is dedicated to manage vacation/sick requests.

Employee hits POST /api/leaves/request?userId=1&startDate=2025-10-01&endDate=2025-10-05

Service checks if user has enough remaining days.

If yes → creates a leave request, approves it, reduces days left.

Employee can view all his leaves at GET /api/leaves/user/{userId}.

Instead of auto-approving inside LeaveService, we’ll separate:

Employee Request → status = PENDING (no deduction yet).

Admin Approves → status = APPROVED (deduction happens).

Admin Rejects → status = REJECTED (no deduction).

approval flow
