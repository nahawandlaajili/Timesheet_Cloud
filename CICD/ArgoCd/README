ArgoCD is a declarative, GitOps-based continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. It automates the synchronization of applications in Kubernetes clusters by tracking the desired state defined in a Git repository.

A multi-cluster deployment refers to deploying applications across multiple Kubernetes clusters, enabling high availability, disaster recovery, and optimized resource utilization. For organizations using AWS, EKS provides a fully managed Kubernetes environment, and with ArgoCD, multi-cluster management becomes streamlined and automated.
